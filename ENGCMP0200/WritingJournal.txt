"Girl" by Jamaica Kincaid
1. The girl is growing up in a culture seemingly obsessed with traditional gender roles and conservative values, constantly warning the girl about appearing like a slut for the most innocent infractions. Although the speaker only seems to speak in her *true voice* twice during the italic sections, the first section "but I don't sing benna on Sundays at all and never in Sunday school" outs her as only mildly displeased with the actual values being enforced (she still refrains from singing suggestive songs on Sundays), but more upset with the constant ordering and nagging that comes with those values. Kincaid's form consists of a constant barrage of insults and commands (likely from her mother) with little punctuation other than a semicolon between sentences. With the entire passage being a single paragraph, the reader is completely swept away by a flow of things the girl cannot or should not do. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly what the girl is thinking or what Kincaid's ultimate purpose is since the main character barely has a voice, but the constant hammering of what's wrong with the girl is certainly seen as a negative, and the reader is free to fill the narrative void with their own interpretations. Personally, I see this piece as a rejection of the notion that every person should morph into some idealized version of what society expects them to be; here a form of the mid-20th century housewife.

It's all in your head; *Well, yeah, that's kind of the point*;
