"Girl" by Jamaica Kincaid
1. The girl is growing up in a culture seemingly obsessed with traditional gender roles and conservative values, constantly warning the girl about appearing like a slut for the most innocent infractions. Although the speaker only seems to speak in her *true voice* twice during the italic sections, the first section "but I don't sing benna on Sundays at all and never in Sunday school" outs her as only mildly displeased with the actual values being enforced (she still refrains from singing suggestive songs on Sundays), but more upset with the constant ordering and nagging that comes with those values. Kincaid's form consists of a constant barrage of insults and commands (likely from her mother) with little punctuation other than a semicolon between sentences. With the entire passage being a single paragraph, the reader is completely swept away by a flow of things the girl cannot or should not do. It's difficult to pinpoint exactly what the girl is thinking or what Kincaid's ultimate purpose is since the main character barely has a voice, but the constant hammering of what's wrong with the girl is certainly seen as a negative, and the reader is free to fill the narrative void with their own interpretations. Personally, I see this piece as a rejection of the notion that every person should morph into some idealized version of what society expects them to be; here a form of the mid-20th century housewife.

Imitating Kincaid allowed me to condense all of the (often contradicting) complaints and demands into a form that matched my state of mind at the time. I went for an approach that used different speakers at work and at home, as well as a more internal voice, but I'm not sure how well it came across. I think if I did a rewrite I'd focus more on just one voice and flesh it out more dynamically. 
Although my version didn't focus on education specifically, the biggest theme I though about when writing was how different environments and having a lot of insults or unhelpful words spoken at you can influence your thoughts and inner monologue and lead to negative self-talk.
