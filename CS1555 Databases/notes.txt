CS1555 DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
Prof Costa

8/19
Database: an integrated collection of related data
  models a real-world enterprise (e.g. university)
  Entities (students, courses)
  Relationships (Adam took CS1555)

Data vs Information
  Bits + Type = Data
  Date + Semantics = Information
  Information + Model = Knowledge

Integrated Storage: all data is stored/manipulated in a *uniform way* on a secondary storage
  too much data for main memory
  share data across applications

Database Management System (DBMS)
  software package to conveniently and efficiently store and manage databases
  Oracle, IBM DB2, SQLServer, MySQL, ...
  Applications <-> DBMS <-> Database

DATA ABSTRACTION
Data Model: a collection of high-level data description constructs that hides low-level details
Relational/Object-Relational Model
  most widely used data model today
  main construce is a *relation* (table of records)
  every relation is a *schema*
    -relation name  -names of fields  -types of fields
  example Schema: Students(sid:string, name:string, age:integer, gpa:real)

Data Definition Language (DDL)
  define schema
  define integrity constraints - ex:unique student ids
Data Manipulation Language (DML)
  Query: to ask questions - ex: which students have GPA>3.5
  to create and modify data
SQL: most widely used DB language (can do both DDL and DML)

3 levels of abstraction in DBMS
  1. Conceptual Schema - DDL
  2. Pysical Schema - SDL
  3. (multiple) External Schema (Views) VDL: view definition language
