CS1510 ALGORITHM DESIGN

8/19
Problem: relation from input to acceptable output
Algorithm: a recipe to solve a problem
Program: a computer implementation to solve a problem

Greedy Algorithms
are myopic - ex: add 1 piece to solution set, remove any pieces that conflict with that piece from consideration

Formal Direct Proof
sequence of statements such that for every statement either:
1. is an assumption
or 2. logically follows from previous step

Formal Proof by Contradiction
Thm: X
Proof: assume X => y => not y. Since y and not y contradict, assumed X must be false
