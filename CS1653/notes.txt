CS1653 APPLIED CRYPTOGRAPHY AND NETWORK SECURITY

8/19
Computer Security Properties: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

CONFIDENTIALITY: need to conceal information or resources
  Data: "nobody should know my bank account balance"
  Existance: "nobody should know I shop at XYZ.com"
  Configuration: "nobody should know what software I run"

Access control systems preserve data confidentiality
  -OS knows which users can access a file
While cryptography preserves data confidentiality, it doesn't provide existence confidentiality

INTEGRITY: trustworthiness of information or resources
  Data: "Is my account balance correct?"
  Origin: "Was this application really written by Microsoft?"
Integrity mechanisms can either prevent or detect breaches
